# Google-Cloud-Hackathon-Dismantling-Disparity-with-Data

# Background:
Healthcare access disparities have seen a notable drop in the last decade thanks to the implementation of policies and legislation but progress has stalled in the past few years. 

# The problem:
Systemic inequalities in healthcare access persist within social, racial and geographical groups and Covid-19 has in some cases worsened the situation, notably when it comes to access.

# Our Goal:
In response to the health crisis, telehealth has seen a massive increase of adoption to improve access to care, reduce disease exposure and decrease patient demand on facilities. 
We aim to identify how telehealth improves healthcare quality and access, which social, racial and geographical groups benefit the most from that service, and build a case in favor of telehealth post pandemic.

# Outcome:
Visualized disparity situation and performed regression analysis using CDC and U.S. Census data. Identify solution to relieve racial, gender and geographical inequality to healthcare access,
